# Tic-Tac-Toe
A small JS project/game, named Tic Tac Toe. At this stage it consists of 3 files: html, css &amp; js. It has been developed throughout my JS Front End studying program in SoftUni at the summer of 2024.


How to Test/run on a local server?
========================

You can run your file in http-server.

1> Have Node.js installed in your system. Check if you have it installed in CMD:
`node --version` or `node -v`

2> Run the command "npm install http-server -g"

3> Navigate to the specific path of your file folder, type -> "cd C:\<folder location>" and run the command "http-server" to start a local server

4> Go to your browser and type in address bar "localhost:8080". Your Application should run now locally on port 8080.
