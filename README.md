# Tic-Tac-Toe
A small JS project/game, named Tic Tac Toe. At this stage it consists of 3 files: html, css &amp; js. It has been developed throughout my JS Front End studying program in SoftUni at the summer of 2024.


How to Test/run on a local server?
==================================

1> Clone repo in an empty folder `git clone https://github.com/S7lkr/Tic-Tac-Toe.git`

2> Have Node.js installed in your system. Check if you have it installed in CMD: `node --version` or `node -v`

3> You can run your file in http-server. Run the command `npm install http-server -g`

4> Navigate to the specific path of your file folder. In CMD type -> "cd C:\<folder location>" and run the command `http-server` to start a local server

5> Go to your browser and type in address bar "localhost:8080". Your Application should run now locally on port 8080.
