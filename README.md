How to Test/run on a local server?
==================================

1> Create a new folder on C: drive. Open CMD and navigate to its location: `cd C:\<folder path>`. Then type: `git clone https://github.com/S7lkr/Tic-Tac-Toe.git`

2> Have Node.js installed in your system. Check if you have it installed: `node --version` or `node -v`

3> You can run your file in http-server. Again in CMD, run the command `npm install http-server -g`

4> Execute command `http-server` to start a local server.

5> Go to your browser and type in address bar "localhost:8080". Your Application should run now locally on port 8080.
